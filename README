One of the guidelines from the seminal book on typography by Robert Bringhurt, 
"The Elements of Typographic Style" states that "In heads and titles, use the
best ampersand available". This plugin attempts to allow you to do just 
that with your text in ExpressionEngine 2.

To use this plugin, wrap anything you want to be processed by it between the 
following tag pairs. Entry titles or headline text works best though it should 
be able to handle most things you can throw at it.

{exp:ampersand:wich}{title}{/exp:ampersand:wich}
